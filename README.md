# ICS2O-04-Side-scroller
My side scroller project for computer science.
Changes made:
1. Object oriented change - made another enemy using a class and changed the images to stars for both the enemy and hero
2. 3 algorithmic changes - changed the amount of enemies that spawn, made it so the hero cannot go off screen, added a tutoriel, changed the starting and ending screen slightly
